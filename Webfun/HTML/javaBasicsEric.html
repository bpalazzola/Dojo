            <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href=#>Variable Declaration</a> Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) — APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
                <li><a href=#>Variable Assignment</a>Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
                <li><a href=#>Data Types</a> Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.</li>
                <li><a href=#>Conditionals</a> Because this article is only supposed to be a light introduction to JavaScript, we are not going to confuse you at this stage by talking in detail about what the difference is between the core JavaScript language and the different tools listed above. You can learn all that in detail later on, in our JavaScript learning area, and in the rest of MDN.</li>
                <li><a href=#>Loops</a> Below we will introduce you some aspects of the core language, and you'll also play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!</li>
                <li><a href=#>Function</a> The above section might sound really exciting, and so it should — JavaScript is one of the most lively web technologies, and as you start to get good at using it, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</li>
